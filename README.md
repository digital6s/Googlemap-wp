# Googlemap-wp
Lite weght code customised google map plugin for wordpress.

The purpose of creating this super lite weight plugin is for development and learning purposes (there are many comments with overly simple explanations - I have done this to reinforce my learning of PHP and JavaScript.  I was getting really annoyed with having 3 or 4 elementor add ons for every little bit of styling and customisation I was wanting, It was slowing down my admin and front end and getting expensive, so I decided its time to start getting more serious about learning to code for web design and development.

To Customise the map style you can update the code in the script.js file There are detailed instructions regarding where to go to generate parts of the code including the style, and other referenced information such as where to generate your long and lat numbers. 

I would have loved to have found something like this, so decided to share for anyone else in my position.
